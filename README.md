# Github Finder

This is a tutorial project presented by [Matheus Battisti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sQITRihW_A).
The main idea is to follow it step-by-step first, and then add smaller adjustments through time.

I added the [standard-version dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version) as a way to feed a changelog with every change, to keep a timeline with everychange, using conventional commits.

### Tech stack:
- Vite
- Typescript
- CSS Modules
- React & React Router
- Conventional Commits
